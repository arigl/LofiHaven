Main idea:
- Lofi music player with a Threejs scene that changes based on the song
- Default scene will have a music player on the left, and a 3d scene on the right.
- Player will include: play, pause, skip, previous, volume
    - Music information will include: Name, Album art, youtube or spotify link possibly 
- Expand button on the 3d scene will make it full screen, with the player transition to a floating widget that shows the song 
- Start with one environment, but add others over time
- Add a lock icon to the 3d scene that makes it so you can't interact with it 

Music
- include attributes alongside each song to change how the 3d scene looks 
- use creative commons songs only
